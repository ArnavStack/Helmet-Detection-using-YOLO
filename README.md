# Helmet-Detection-using-YOLO
This project uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time helmet detection to identify whether riders are wearing helmets or not. The model detects motorcyclists and classifies them as Helmet or No Helmet from images or video streams, enabling fast and accurate safety monitoring.
